When you reach the higher tiers of their rewards program, you can also qualify for free shipping on your orders. Occasionally, we might have a free shipping promo code on this page too. &nbsp;</p><h3>Can I get a Supergoop welcome offer?</h3><p>New customers can receive a 10% Supergoop discount code welcome offer to use on their next order. It's a great way to make some savings if you haven't shopped with Supergoop before.&nbsp;</p><h3>When does Supergoop have sales?</h3><p>One of the best times to shop for Supergoop sunscreen is during their seasonal sales, such as Black Friday. Last year, there were discounts of up to 20% off selected skincare favorites. Whilst this is a smaller discount up to other brands, it’s still one of the best times to save at Supergoop. &nbsp;</p><h3>Can I get a student discount at Supergoop?</h3><p>Sadly, Supergoop does not offer any student discounts at this moment. However, you can still save on your sunscreen and skincare orders as a student with a promo code from our page. Signing up for the rewards program is also a great way to get regular promotions and coupons. &nbsp;</p><h3>Does Supergoop offer returns?</h3><p>Supergoop offers returns within 30 days of purchase, except on final sale products. Just make sure that the item is in unused condition to be eligible for a return or exchange.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=hints-and-tips-3>Hints and tips</h2><p><strong>Email Promotions: </strong>If you’re about to upgrade your sunscreen routine, then signing up for the Supergoop newsletter can help you save on your order.
