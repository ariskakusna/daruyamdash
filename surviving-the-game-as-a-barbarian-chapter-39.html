The Magic Tower is a powerful and mysterious organization that controls the magic and the secrets of the world. They have been targeting Lee Hansoo ever since he entered the game, because they believe that he has something to do with the labyrinth, the mysterious dungeon that holds the key to the origin of the world and the game.</p><p>The assassins were skilled and ruthless, and they used various tricks and traps to ambush Lee Hansoo and his party. They also had a sixth rank wizard, Arua Raven, who was a former member of the Magic Tower, and who betrayed them for unknown reasons. Arua was a powerful and cunning enemy, who used her magic to manipulate the elements and the environment.</p><p>Lee Hansoo and his party fought back with all their strength, and they managed to kill some of the assassins. However, they were also injured and exhausted, and they were outnumbered and outmatched. Lee Hansoo used his barbarian skills, such as rage, berserk, and bloodlust, to increase his power and speed. He also used his items, such as the sword of the dragon slayer, the ring of the fire lord, and the necklace of the wind spirit, to enhance his abilities and deal more damage.</p><p>Lee Hansoo managed to kill one of the assassins, but he was also stabbed by another one. He felt a sharp pain in his chest, and he realized that the assassin had used a poisoned dagger. He tried to resist the poison, but he felt his strength and consciousness fading away. He saw Arua approaching him, and he wondered if this was the end. He thought about his friends, his family, and his life in the game. He wondered if he would ever see them again. He closed his eyes, and the chapter ended with a cliffhanger.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_To_Read_This_Manhwa_Online></span><strong>Where To Read This Manhwa Online?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You can read Surviving The Game as a Barbarian chapter 39 from official sources, such as the Naver Web Novel platform, the KakaoPage website, or the Daum Webtoon website.
