By the time she was 21 she had won nearly every major title she competed in and still remains the only person to have ever won the British Open to the World Latin American Championships in Blackpool with two different partners.</p><p id=eW970rYJHTo data-wc=44>Shirley also holds the title of the&nbsp;youngest ever female to reach the British Open to the World Dance Championship finals&nbsp;and is a European, German, UK, USA and International Latin American Champion, becoming known as the ‘Queen of Latin’ for her acclaimed rumba.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eB6kFV8_xVF data-wc=61>Shirley retired from competitive dancing in 1996 and has since become a much sought-after dance coach as well as a leading Ballroom and Latin competition judge, author and TV personality. She joined the BBC’s in 2017, taking over from Len Goodman as head judge and leads the current panel of Motsi Mabuse, Craig Revel-Horwood and Anton Du Beke.</p><p id=e_F1KrWx8l8 data-wc=64>Her judging approach is “All about the four F's; fun, firm, feisty and fair. I may look and come across as quite strict, but I want the celebrities to know that when they are stood in front of me my heart will be pumping a thousand miles an hour for them in that moment and I'll want to give them comments to inspire them."</p><p id=egsThM_UTEe data-wc=94>Sharing her behind the scenes beauty secrets, Shirley tells “When I was competing in ballroom in the ’80s one of the things I regret most was having those big bouffant hair dos. You used to pull it up and backcomb it with the tail comb, all the way until it held, and then when you used to take it out all your hair was in the brush. We also had those tight slicked-back buns with lots of gel. I won two Blackpools with my hair in a short black bob with a fringe!"</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ea2qnR5CzAC data-wc=87>"One of the worst things we did when competing was to get Bostick superglue and stick rhinestones down the centre of the head, directly onto our hair. Earrings were glued onto our ears, I can still feel them now! If you didn’t have a tube of Bostick you weren’t in the running for the title! After the competition you’d just pull it all out, and your hair would be stuck up like a hedgehog! I’m surprised I’ve got any hair left, it’s really been through the mill.”</p><p id=egYS2VqchlXA data-wc=67>Telling how motherhood affected her hair, Shirley confides: “When I had my son my hair got so thin and fell out, while he came out with the thickest head of hair – a mass of curls like a girl – and he still has them now! He has to shave it all at the back, but I’ve got hair that needs products to thicken and boost.”</p><p id=emOV3V5bgAev data-wc=38>Shirley has also bravely spoken out about her experience with menopause. She was 47 when she started to notice symptoms. "From night sweats to day sweats, to dry skin, nails and hair, I felt moody and completely off.</p><p id=eeQOFZp23vm6 data-wc=45>“I went from feeling strong and self-assured to such a dark place. Before that I’d never even thought about the menopause – it was such a taboo subject. I just thought my symptoms could be the flu. Nobody talked about it, I felt totally ill-prepared."</p><p id=e7iNaBV5DY6A data-wc=53>Shirley describes her dry skin as being "like dandruff from your hair but on your body. My nails used to split so I put false nails on, my hair was coming out in clumps. The hormones change, the hair starts to thin and you can see it all coming out in your hairbrush.</p><p id=eX0nY8BDvuBv data-wc=66>“There were night sweats, irritability and a lack of libido – you name it! The whole body from top to bottom just didn't function the way I was used to it functioning. I felt anxious, I didn't want to be in company. I had heart palpitations. I tended not to go out unless I absolutely had to – I didn't even want to go to work.</p><p id=eUEECSPkPiLz data-wc=45>“My son Mark (now 37) could see something was wrong. He just couldn't understand how I could go from this bright, upbeat mother who was running around all the time to not being able to get out of bed, in my pyjamas all day, miserable.</p><p id=eAXDFooWNDd4 data-wc=51>"I was so embarrassed to talk to him about it, but he was the first person to really listen to me. He took me to a hormone doctor and they started me on bio-identical hormones. I just told them, 'I want to get out of this dark place, whatever it takes.'</p><p id=ezRo4G6mFYWM data-wc=39>“My advice to women would be the minute your body starts to change from what is normal for you – whether it's at 35 or much later– go and talk to someone and find out exactly what's going on.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Exclusive: Ola Jordan opens up about post-partum hair loss and the products that have helped" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ff4bb8153500-ola-jordan-john-frieda.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Exclusive: Ola Jordan opens up about post-partum hair loss and the products that have helped" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Exclusive: Ola Jordan opens up about post-partum hair loss and the products that have helped</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What's causing your hair loss?

I keep a mat and weights in my dressing room so I can exercise around fittings and rehearsals.</p><p id=eAclbagauMLS data-wc=65>“The first thing I do when I come home after the show is take out my hair extensions – you’d be surprised at how many there are! I also take half an hour on my own in the bathroom to remove my makeup and apply a sheet mask, and repair my skin after wearing heavy makeup for TV. I enjoy the occasional salon facial too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/caa772261d1e-shirley-ballas.png><p id=e9lBLRA6Au2S data-wc=69>Sharing her current haircare regime, Shirley says: “I wash my hair every morning, and once I’ve shampooed and conditioned I have a freezing cold shower to smooth the cuticle and lock in moisture. When you get out of the shower you feel so rejuvenated, so that’s my top tip! I also sleep on a lovely soft silk pillowcase so my hair doesn’t pull against it and there’s less friction.</p><p id=e8SGk82kAo0U data-wc=40>“I like to blowdry my hair straight as it’s got a natural wave, and I think it can look a bit scruffy otherwise. I like it with product in to thicken it up then styled into a straight, sleek bob.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZgz-ULbNUQn data-wc=45>“I’ve had every kind of shampoo in my bathroom but I got <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">John Frieda PROfiller+ products</a> a few weeks ago, and I have to say they’ve done wonders for my hair. There’s less breakage, and I find it’s much more plump, so it’s more full.</p><p id=eM_YKwalXW60 data-wc=48>“I love the conditioner because it doesn’t make it feel thick and greasy. It’s easy to brush, easy to blowdry. I’m a fan! The smell is divine – I’ve got a thing about smell. The scent of this range is really lovely and the texture is lovely too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/99b81772100e-shirley-ballas-2.png><p id=e6g4C9ndKxot data-wc=61>A new innovation from the haircare professionals, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">John Frieda’s PROfiller+ range</a> comprises of three products to bolster fine and fragile strands against breakage and help them appear stronger.
