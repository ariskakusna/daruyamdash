Photo / Supplied</p><p>It's a wrap: After a whirlwind courtship and five months of PDA-packed globetrotting, <strong>Blake Lively</strong> and <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> have split.</p><p>Reps for the <i>Gossip Girl</i> actress, 24, and the Inception star, 36, <a href=#>confirmed the split to <i>Us Weekly</i></a>.</p><p>But, as is the norm when any hot Hollywood romance hits the skids, we're told the split was amicable, and they "remain friends".</p><p>The pair was first spotted together last November during a group dinner organised by director <strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong>. According to <i><a href=#>Deadline</a></i>, Lively was on Luhrmann's shortlist of actors to play Daisy Buchanan in his current film project, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. <strong>Carey Mulligan</strong> eventually bagged the role.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The actors then set headlines alight after <a href=#>they were snapped getting cozy</a> and cavorting on <strong>Steven Spielberg's</strong> yacht during the Cannes Film Festival in May.</p><p>They also clocked time together <a href=#>while sightseeing in Italy</a>, bike-riding in New York City, followed by <a href=#>a romantic pit stop in Disneyland</a>.</p><p>And just last month, Lively jetted to Australia to visit DiCaprio as he toiled on the set of <i>Gatsby</i>. The pair was also spotted celebrating Lively's 24th birthday at a swanky Sydney eatery.</p><p>Said a spy: "[Blake] looked gorgeous and they looked very much like a couple. They seemed to be having a really nice time and were definitely enjoying the view."</p><p>News of the split may come as a shock to some of DiCaprio's pals, who observed that the pair appeared to be smitten, reports Us Weekly.</p><p>"[I have] never seen him like this with a girl," said one pal.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>Another mate recalled a romantic interlude back in June while the lovebirds were shacked up in DiCaprio's L.A. pad.</p><p>"[Lively] spent the whole time baking ... Leo's never dated a girl who can cook. And he's smitten!" said the snitch. One insider even predicted: "I bet they get engaged in six months."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>So what happened? There's been no official word on what drove the twosome apart. Although sources tell <i>E! News</i> that "distance and timing caused the split." That old chestnut.</p><p>Lively, however, isn't crying in her corn flakes and lamenting the end of the short-lived romance. She's already been linked to one of Hollywood's most eligible actors - <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>!</p><p>According to <a href=#>a report in the <i>Boston Herald</i></a>, the <i>Gossip Girl</i> star and Reynolds were spotted boarding a train from New York to Boston on Friday, where he's filming <i>R.I.P.D.</i></p><p>They were later spied having dinner together at sushi restaurant, O Ya, in Boston's Leather District.</p><p>In tabloid terms, they're practically married.</p><p>No word from their reps on the latest tattle.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><strong>Rihanna says she's no role model</strong></p><p>Good girl gone bad <strong>Rihanna</strong> says she's not interested in being a role model for her fans.</p><p>The Barbadian warbler hits up the <a href=#>latest issue of <i>Vogue</i> UK</a>, and waxes lyrical about her raunchy image (she's not really that vampy, apparently), how she's scoring on the romance front, and her penchant for dropping c-bombs.</p><p>On being a role model: "See people - especially white people - they want me to be a role model just because of the life I lead. The things I say in my songs, they expect it of me and [being a role model] became more of my job that I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it."</p><p>On her stage persona: "That's not me. That's a part I play. You know, like it's a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with."</p><p>On her 'see you next Tuesday' slips: "It's funny. The word is so offensive to everyone in the world except for Bajans.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"You know African Americans use the n-word to their brothers? Well that's the way we use the c-word. When I first came here, I was saying it like it was nothing, like, 'Hey c***', until my make-up artist finally had to tell me to stop. I just never knew."</p><p>Meanwhile, the farmer who stopped RiRi from <a href=#>frolicking topless in his field</a> last week has reportedly been bombarded with hate mail from some of the singer's grumpy fans.</p><p><strong>Alan Graham</strong> told the singer to cover up after he spotted her peeling off her clobber and running around topless during the video shoot for <i>We Found Love</i> in Northern Ireland.</p><p>According <a href=#>to <i>The Sun</i></a>, some of Rihanna's fans have been less than complimentary.</p><p>He said: "I'm taking it all in my stride, it'll soon die down. To be honest, all this fuss has kept me back a bit. I've got straw to harvest that I haven't been able to finish yet."</p><p>Graham also said he'd received mail from fans asking to buy some of the corn in his field - which was touched by Rihanna during her rural escapade.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>He added: "I don't think I'll be doing that, but maybe I'll name a type of grain after her."</p><p>And to prove he harbours no ill-feeling towards Rihanna, he's willing to ask her back to his farm for a tête-à-tête, "just so long as I know what she's wearing before the visit".</p><p>I've got <a href=#>just the outfit</a>.</p><p><strong>Kanye West, designer: Hot or not?</strong></p><p>Rapper-turned-fashion-designer <strong>Kanye West</strong> celebrated the launch of his fashion range over the weekend.</p><p>West launched his first-ever collection during Paris Fashion Week on Saturday night, in front of celebrity pals, including <strong>Jared Leto, Lindsay Lohan, Mary-Kate</strong> and <strong>Ashley Olsen</strong>, and fashion heavyweight <strong>Anna Wintour</strong>.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But no sooner had the models hit the runway with his clobber, critics were furiously thundering their keyboards <a href=#>with their verdicts</a>.</p><p>"Necklines plunged so precariously that they seemed a personal shout-out to J-Lo," wrote <strong>Christina Binkley</strong> of <i>Heard on the Runway</i>.</p><p>"Next season Kanye should get a tailor so clothes might fit," <i>New York Times</i> fashion critic <a href=#><strong>Cathy Horyn</strong> tweeted</a>. "Models swimming in some looks. Kills the hot look, no?"</p><p><strong>Lisa Armstrong</strong>, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>: "Kanye West's fashion debut was like being subjected to an hour-long MRI scan - but not as much fun ... It was the equivalent of Karl Lagerfeld launching a hip-hop career: i.e. absurd."</p><p><a href=#>While Women's Wear Daily</a> was not as snippy, calling the show "neither triumph nor train wreck," noting, "it had the earnest veneer of a beginner, which was sort of endearing".</p><p>Naturally, the rapper had a few choice words for his critics during the show's after party. Or as <i>WWD</i> put it, he "launched into a stream-of-consciousness, obscenity-laced tirade".</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>And go: "This is my first collection. Please be easy. Please give me a chance to grow.</p><p>"This is not some celebrity s***. I don't f*** with celebrities. I f*** with the creatives in this room, the amazing people who spend every day of their life trying to make the world a more beautiful place.</p><p>"The amount of people that tried to get me a celebrity f***ing deal. They said, 'You need to do boot-cut jeans, or you won't sell.' Shut the f*** up ! Or Hedi Slimane in the motherf***ing Mercer, sitting with me, saying, 'Stop giving them your ideas, Kanye. Do your own thing.' Hedi Slimane! To feel so frustrated."</p><p>He added: "And I thank anybody who came to this party, everybody who supported, everybody who believed, because people thought it was a joke, and maybe people still do, but I can only grow from this point."</p><p>Reckon Kanye can cut it in the fashion world?
