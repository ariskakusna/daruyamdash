Both were concerned that George’s role as a Page of Honor might put him under too much pressure, but, ultimately, as we saw on May 6, the Palace won out, and George seemed to handle everything seamlessly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YW5WgYSvaYAV3QRFN854Y-1920-80.jpg><p>Much ado has been made of late about George’s potential future at Eton, the school where both his father William and his uncle <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-harry/>Prince Harry</a> attended; both William and Harry boarded at Eton, which educates boys ages 13 to 18. (George will turn 13 on July 22, 2026, and, if admitted, would likely start at Eton that fall.) Early in the summer, William, Kate, and George were seen visiting the exclusive boarding school, signaling that Eton was likely in George’s future. Though George won’t begin at Eton until fall 2026, boys who plan to attend the school<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/prince-george-big-decision-eton-college/> <u>must register by June 30</u></a> of the school year that they turn 10, which was this past summer. (George turned 10 on July 22.) Eton isn’t far from Adelaide Cottage in Windsor, where George lives with his parents and his younger siblings Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.</p><p>George will sit for entrance exams to Eton next month, coincidentally the same week that William will be in Singapore for his third annual Earthshot Prize Awards. Driving home the importance of these exams for George’s educational future, Kate has opted to forgo traveling to Singapore with her husband in favor of being there for her eldest son as he takes the exams, marking the first time she will miss the Earthshot Prize Awards since the awards ceremony’s inception in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oDnCRgvLFWTok66QMQnwZE-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PzXbS56CR5YmBqDZPkDShD-1920-80.jpg><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://okmagazine.com/p/tension-prince-william-kate-middleton-feuding-son-george-boarding-school/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>OK</u></a> reports that there is another disagreement brewing over George, but this time about Eton, and this time, William and Kate don’t appear to be on the same side. The outlet reports that “there’s a lot of tension” surrounding the decision to board George, and that Kate is “dead set against it.”</p><p>“Kate thinks sending him to such a stuffy, upper-crust institution goes against all of their efforts to modernize the monarchy,” a source said. “Plus, she’ll miss George desperately.”</p><p>Although the couple “argued about it for years,” they said, “he [William] has finally won.”</p><p>It seems like George himself played a role in the decision as well, as they said “he wants to be just like his father,” who, of course, attended Eton. Though Kate “finally gave in, she’s still heartbroken” over sending George off in three years’ time.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

There is also a $500 registration fee. William was the first senior royal to attend Eton, enrolling at age 13 in 1995; prior to William breaking the mold, most boys in the royal family attended Gordonstoun in Scotland. William’s mother Princess Diana’s father and brother both attended Eton, and William’s experience was incredibly positive there: “He forged a series of close friendships that endure to this day and, like his father’s more grueling experience in Scotland, it instilled in him a resilience that has served him well,” writes royal expert Richard Kay. “Eton also gave William a taste for independence and privacy that is difficult to find for young royals, whose lives are so often under the spotlight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taPuRxGPGqXCBxz5iyTtSQ-1920-80.jpg><p>George, Charlotte, and Louis all currently attend Lambrook School, where they are day pupils, returning home to Adelaide Cottage at the end of each school day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiqn66urb%2BOqamippOaeri1y6WgmqVdpb%2BqusKeqqxlm5bBpnnDoqqan6Kasq6xza1kqaqZo7CmecaepquflWKytbvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1593678-breaking-tinubu-sacks-wikes-ally-protests-appoints-replacement.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tinubu Removes Wikes Ally After Protests, Appoints Replacement">&larr;
