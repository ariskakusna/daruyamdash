He would whisper to people. [But] when he got onstage, he was like a general.”</p><p class=paragraph-text>Don said that after the show aired it had a huge impact and a few days later he saw just how much it had affected people.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The producer was in Washington to film an interview with the first lady, Nancy Reagan, and says he remembers, “Coming down the elevator [of the hotel], everybody’s talking about Michael. In the taxicab going to the White House, everybody was talking about Michael. In the East Wing [of the White House] … everybody’s talking about&nbsp;Motown 25&nbsp;and Michael.”</p><p class=paragraph-text>He added, “We do these kinds of things and we never know how people are going to react, but that morning in Washington … suddenly I said to myself, ‘This show really had an incredible impact.’”</p><p class=paragraph-text><a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> would later go on to discuss his own experience of his first moonwalk in an interview with <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> in 1993 and said he 'cried' after the performance.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I'm never satisfied," <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> said, "Even when I see something that I've done, and people say: 'Oh it was phenomenal'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"When I did Motown 25, and I did the moonwalk for the first time, I was backstage crying afterwards because I was unhappy."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Oprah was stunned. "You cried!?" she said in disbelief.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"But then I was walking to the car there was this little boy who was like 12," Michael continued.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He was this little Jewish kid and he said: 'You're amazing! Who taught you to dance like that?'"</p><p class=paragraph-text>"And for the first time I ever felt like I did a good job," he concluded.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Because I know children don't lie, and I just felt so good about it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>In the same 1993 Oprah Winfrey interview, Elizabeth Taylor also discussed her impression of Michael Jackson.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He is the least weird man I've ever known," the Cleopatra star said.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He is highly intelligent. Shrewd. Intuitive. Understanding. Sympathetic. Generous, to almost a fault of himself.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He just - if he has any eccentricities it's that he is larger than life. And some people can't accept that, or face it, or understand it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>Elizabeth Taylor added: "His talent on stage - on why I called him the king of pop rock soul music entertainment, whatever - there's nobody that can come near him; [or] dance like that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJmiqba0wNJopKKbmJayrXnJmpqkq5%2BjfKe10ayrZqWfpLu4rcukZKanpKTEr3nVopuep11mhnl%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./behati-prinsloo-victorias-secret-controversy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Victoria's Secret Controversy Is Preventing Behati Prisloo From Living Her Best Life">&larr;
