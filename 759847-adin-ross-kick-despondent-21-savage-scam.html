Essentially, the face cards were marked, which would allow 21 to win with ease. Overall, it was a stunning revelation that had the entire chat accusing 21 of scamming. However, 21 seemed shocked by the whole thing and said it wasn't him who brought the cards. Instead, someone else from inside his team brought them, and must have done that without his knowledge.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-adin-ross-x-21-savage>Adin Ross x 21 Savage</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Considering just how bold and brazen this all way, very few are actually riding with 21 on this one. While it is plausible that it was an honest mistake on his part, you could tell the stream got awkward after that. In the clip above, Ross could be described as despondent as 21 apologized and promised to give Ross the money he's owed. However, they looked like they were over each other, and 21 eventually rushed to get out. From there, Ross looked sad in his chair and ended the stream shortly after. Now, the whole thing is going viral, and 21 is being questioned over his alleged involvement.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this situation, in the comments section below.
