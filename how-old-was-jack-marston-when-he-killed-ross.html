Now under the player's control, he buries his mother and, free from any obligations, decides to hunt down Ross and kill him, even though the agent's now retired from the Bureau and the murder won't bring anyone back.</span></span><h2>How old is Jack Marston in the epilogue?</h2>Epilogue. I ain't going nowhere old man! Jack confronting Ross, "Remember My Family". A nineteen year old Jack, fresh after burying his mother.<h2>How old is Jack Marston in RDR3?</h2>Jack is 19 at the end of Red Dead Redemption. Unless he died very shortly after the first game's epilogue ends, he could easily have had time to write the book during his lifetime. RDR3 can leave the old west behind at the same time that Jack does.<h2>How old was John Marston at death?</h2>They place a wooden cross over his grave that reads "Loving Husband and Father. Blessed are the Peacemakers." John's birth year is carved directly above the eulogy and is revealed to be 1873. RDR takes place over one year, in 1911. That means John was 38 years old when he died in the original Red Dead Redemption.<h2>How old is John Marston at the end of RDR2?</h2>John was therefore born in 1873 which makes him 26 in Red Dead Redemption 2 and 38 in Red Dead Redemption.<h2>Red Dead Redemption - Jack Marston kills Edgar Ross and avenges his Father</h2><p></p><h2>How old is Sadie Adler?</h2>4 Sadie Adler (25)<p>Sadie's age is never really confirmed anywhere, but the running idea is that she's somewhere in her mid-to-late 20s, so landing right in the middle is the safest bet.</p><h2>How old was Dutch when died?</h2>Gallery. ↑ Dan Houser said Dutch was “about 60 years old” in Red Dead Redemption.<h2>How old was Abigail Marston when he died?</h2>In 1914, Abigail Marston dies at approximately 37 years of age from unknown causes, and Jack buries her on the hill of the ranch next to John and Uncle.<h2>Is Javier Escuella Jack's dad?</h2>Given the obvious attraction Arthur Morgan and Abigail share in RDR2, you might assume that Jack was Arthur's secret child, but the good people of Reddit have in fact speculated that Jack's real father is none other than Javier Escuella.<h2>Does Jack Marston wear Arthur's jacket?</h2>Jack Marston's Jacket (RDR1) | Fandom. The tan jacket that Jack wears after you finish the story is the same exact one that Arthur wears.<h2>Will there be a rdr3?</h2>Red Dead Redemption 3 is a game many are hoping for, but no announcements for it have been made. Sadly, it seems fans will be waiting for a long time. Several major game releases have been announced thus far in 2022, but Red Dead Redemption 3 is not among the list of upcoming titles.<h2>Is Arthur mentioned in rdr1?</h2>Even in 1907, he's barely mentioned at all, so history forgot about him. By 1911, he's not mentioned at all, which does make sense in some ways because, as said, he went down in history as one of a group and anything he did was thought to have been done by the gang as a whole.<h2>How old is Abigail Roberts in RDR2?</h2>In fact, Abigail is only 22 throughout the events of Red Dead Redemption II. It is said that she was born in 1877, and the events of RDR II take place some time in 1899.<h2>Did Arthur sleep with Abigail?</h2>Abigail Marston<p>It is hinted by Dutch that Arthur may have had sex with Abigail before her relationship with John, as did the other members of the gang, when he is confronted by John at the bank in Blackwater in 1911.</p><h2>Is Sadie Adler in rdr1?</h2>Both games feature a heavy story mixed with characters from all walks of life, many of who are well written and serve the game in various ways. Among these characters are Bonnie MacFarlane and Sadie Adler, who make their first appearances in RDR 1 and RDR 2, respectively.<h2>What is uncle's real name in RDR2?</h2>Uncle (John O'Creagh and James McBride) is one of the oldest members of the Van der Linde gang. He is a drunkard who claims to have had several wives and traveled significantly. He also claims to have been a talented gunslinger in his younger age, and contends that he suffers from terminal lumbago.<h2>How old is Charles RDR2?</h2>In fact, the post was so surprising that it quickly went viral. If you haven't seen the post yet, it reveals the following character ages: Hosea Matthews (55), Dutch van der Linde (44), Micah Bell (39), Arthur Morgan (36), Bill Williamson (33), Charles Smith (27), John Marston (26), and Molly O'Shea (Mid-20s).<h2>How old is Dutch?</h2>The standard Dutch language has mainly developed from Brabantian and later some Hollandish dialects from post 16th century. The Standard Dutch language has evolved little since the 16th century.<h2>Was Uncle Red Harlow?</h2>Red Harlow isn't Uncle because he is roughly the same age as John Marston in the games, Red Harlow was born like between 1860 to 1870 and Red Dead Revolver takes place around 1880's likely in 1888 and so they couldn't be the same person at all.<h2>Why did Javier not point his gun?</h2>Javier does not point his gun at either Arthur or John during the gang's standoff at Beaver Hollow, suggesting that he still had some degree of friendship with at least one of them. Gabriel Sloyer, the voice actor for Javier in Red Dead Redemption 2, has stated that Javier not aiming his gun at John or Arthur during ...<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormannJl6uK3SZqGam5tiuqK%2B0q2mp2WnnbKveceeZKShnKGypXnRqKqs</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-honkai-star-rail-1-2-pay-win.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Honkai Star Rail 1.2 pay to win?">&larr;
