He was born in Harlem, Manhattan, to dancer Elvera Davis (nÃ©e Sanchez) and vaudeville star Sammy Davis Sr. He was a multi-talented performer, excelling in singing, dancing, and acting. He was a member of the Rat Pack and was known for his performances in films, television, and on Broadway. He was also a civil rights activist and was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP.<br><b>Sammy Davis Jr. is a member of <a href=#>Soundtrack</a></b><h2>Age, Biography and Wiki</h2><h2><span class=inline-icon>ðŸ’°</span> Net worth</h2><table><tr class=odd><td>Anna Lucasta&nbsp;(1958)</td><td>$50,000</td></tr><tr class=even><td>Ocean's Eleven&nbsp;(1960)</td><td>$125,000</td></tr></table><p>Sammy Davis Jr. was often billed as the "greatest living entertainer in the world".</p><p>He was born in Harlem, Manhattan, the son of dancer Elvera Davis (nÃ©e Sanchez) and vaudeville star Sammy Davis Sr.. His father was African-American and his mother was of Puerto Rican ancestry. Davis Jr. was known as someone who could do it all--sing, dance, play instruments, act, do stand-up--and he was known for his self-deprecating humor; he once heard someone complaining about discrimination, and he said, "You got it easy. I'm a short, ugly, one-eyed, black Jew. What do you think it's like for me?" (he had converted to Judaism).</p><p>A short stint in the army opened his eyes to the evils of racism--a slight man, he was often beaten up by bigger white soldiers and given the dirtiest and most dangerous assignments by white officers simply because he was black--and he helped break down racial barriers in show business in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Las Vegas, where he often performed; when he started there in the early 1950s, he was not allowed to stay in the hotels he played in, as they refused to take blacks as customers. He also stirred up a large amount of controversy in the 1960s by openly dating, and ultimately marrying, blonde, blue-eyed, Swedish-born actress May Britt.</p><p>He starred in the Broadway musical "Golden Boy" in the 1960s. Initially a success, internal tensions, production problems and bad reviews--many of them directed at Davis for playing a role originally written for a white man--resulted in its closing fairly quickly. His film and nightclub career were in full swing, however, and he became even more famous as one of the "Rat Pack", a group of free-wheeling entertainers that included Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Joey Bishop and <a href=#>Peter Lawford</a>.</p><p>A chain smoker, Davis died from throat cancer at the age of 64. When he died, he was in debt. To pay for Davis' funeral, most of his memorabilia was sold off.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmejlrquxYydmK%2Bho2K3s3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWpncHBp</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./scott-disick-net-worth-207305.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scott Disick Net Worth">&larr;
