With <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">two full-length projects that caught the world's attention in I AM YOU and We All Shine</a>, the young star looked poised to follow&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar path as somebody like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a>.&nbsp;Unafraid to use his voice as an instrument, Melly was&nbsp;ballsy with his releases,&nbsp;playing around and trying new things;&nbsp;that's&nbsp;usually a strong sign that the artist truly cares about shaping the game and making an impact.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/31/91/399131_eaf8db45929539b8b6b2224d891b5415.jpg><p><h2>"Virtual (Blue Balenciagas)"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You'll realize after navigating&nbsp;through this sample size of YNW Melly's&nbsp;catalog that the rapper loves to sing about violent scenes that he has either witnessed first-hand or imagined in his head. "Blue Balenciagas" can serve as somewhat of a warm-up for anybody&nbsp;unaccustomed&nbsp;to Melly's lyrical stylings. The entire track is about getting his blue sneakers bloody after "catching an opp." The star&nbsp;gets graphic with his imagery, noting that he'll "leave your brain marinating on the boulevard" and mobbing out with semi-automatic guns in the official music video. This song was initially released as part of Melly's I AM YOU mixtape.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"City Girls"&nbsp;</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Not every song that YNW Melly has released&nbsp;is a street anthem. Sometimes, he&nbsp;sings directly to his significant other, crafting love songs and making them stand out&nbsp;through his&nbsp;exceptional&nbsp;work with melodies. "City Girls" is not a song about the Miami duo signed to Quality Control. However, he does sing to one specific Floridian girl, offering to change her life and&nbsp;serve as her support system. Much like Yung Miami and JT though, YNW Melly says that the girl he's after doesn't love anybody but herself, Chanel and her lace-front weave. We've got some original percussion techniques used here before things get a little jazzy in the chorus.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Melly The Menace"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">YNW Melly&nbsp;liked to speak&nbsp;about <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his split personalities: Melly and Melvin</a>. The artist, whose real name is Jamell Demons, burst onto the scene with his hit single "Murder On My Mind" but another joint that caught people's attention was "Melly The Menace." Featuring clever wordplay about Taraji P. Henson, Empire and vampires, this is one of Melly's most obvious displays of playful and skilled lyricism. This is a nice shift from the vicious&nbsp;imagery presented in his other songs.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Butter Pecan"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is another track that sees YNW Melly painting a picture with his words. If ever you're unsure of the artist's talent and potential, revisit "Butter Pecan" because this is truly unlike anything else being released today. Melly flexes his voice in so many directions, taking this song to new heights through his&nbsp;performance alone. This song could easily have been deemed a "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Sold Out Dates</a>" rip-off with a guitar-laced beat and a smooth chord progression. However, Melly made sure to make it stand out. Sometimes, his notes fall flat but he's trying to be original and that&nbsp;has to count for something.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Freddy Krueger" (feat. Tee Grizzley)&nbsp;</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At this point, you know that YNW Melly can get pretty menacing in his lyrics. This is another one of the tracks that showcase just how far he's willing to go to stay true to the people he loves. Using everybody's favourite horror movie mainstay as an indication of what he's willing to pull, Melly graces your nightmares&nbsp;in a fashion similar to&nbsp;Freddy Krueger. Teaming up with Detroit's own Tee Grizzley, Melly tells everybody that he's got shooters across the country, from the D to Florida.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Mama Cry"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If you want to understand the difference between Melly and Melvin, this song should serve as your go-to. Written in prison and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">released on his I AM YOU&nbsp;tape</a>, this is a letter from the man behind the music to his mother. It's one of the most vulnerable pieces that Melvin ever wrote, going deep into his thoughts and praying for his mom to forgive him for all of the&nbsp;sins he's committed. Admitting that he breaks down after every phone call, Melly uses his trademark techniques to get the listener&nbsp;as close to&nbsp;his jail cell as possible.&nbsp;The rapper sings with emotion as he details the cold showers he takes, the cold&nbsp;food he eats, and his&nbsp;frigid heart. This is not one of his better songs in terms of his work with melody but it's a must to understand his complicated mind.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"772 Love"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A true Florida boy, "772 Love" is both a love song to his girl and to his home state. Much like the last&nbsp;track on our list, there are some questionable choices made in the song's production that take a toll on its replay value. However, this is another one of Melly's more personal joints. He shows off his voice and switches his subject matter up completely,&nbsp;turning into a 90's R&B singer for a few minutes before transforming back into&nbsp;the threatening character he portrayed so realistically.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Legendary (Remix)" feat. John Wicks</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is one of the&nbsp;oldest songs on our list, having been released in 2017. Appearing on the Collect Call EP, the Florida-bred rapper flexes over a video-game inspired beat with John Wicks. This song has maintained its position as one of Melly's best songs to date. His infectious hook served as a preview for what we could expect on his then-upcoming full-length projects. "Legendary" is catchy as hell and has some insane replay value.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Mixed Personalities (feat. Kanye West)"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If it weren't for this song, many of us would still have no clue who the hell YNW Melly even is. The young Floridian somehow hit the jackpot while planning out his We All Shine album, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">earning Kanye West's attention and even grabbing him for a feature</a>. Granted, this was&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">during the same time period that Ye worked with Lil Pump</a> but still, it's pretty special that of all people, Melly stood out to Kanye. It speaks a lot to his originality and his drive. This is his second most popular song and it's essential to check it out if you're curious&nbsp;as to where the 20-year-old was headed before his entire world flipped upside down.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>"Murder On My Mind"</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This list would be incomplete <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">without the song that burst YNW Melly into musical superstardom</a>. It's both the most enjoyable song from his arsenal and the most disturbing. With the artist now facing the death penalty, "Murder On My Mind" tells us so much about Melly. The lyrics are explicit and the video is just as disturbing, showing somebody laying on the pavement, struggling to stay alive after being shot. The first verse is vibey but once we get to the second verse, details of the shooting are so vivid that the listener has to do a double take.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide/His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized/I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise/I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice," raps Melly. Many believe that this song was written&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">about the two men that Melly reportedly killed last summer</a> but this track has actually been out since 2017. Still, it offers a look into just how twisted his teenage brain was and what it possibly led him to do.<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" data-id=15272887 rel="nofollow noopener"><br></a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbX93fJNmsKevXaKyrbjYZmhpZZWowKa606KYpWWjpLuov4ynnLCr</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zhuri-james-lebron-james-daughter-age-wikipedia-biography-height-birthday-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zhuri James, LeBron James Daughter Age, Wikipedia, Biography Height, Birthday, Net Worth">&larr;
