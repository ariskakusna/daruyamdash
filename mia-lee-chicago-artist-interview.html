Growing up as a southside native of Caribbean descent, Lee developed a particular perspective on navigating life as a Black woman—a factor that’s helped her stand out in the crowded scene of emerging artists who call the city home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lee uses painting as a storytelling tool to connect the lore of her family’s past to the experiences of the Black diaspora today. The concept of legacy is at the forefront of her work. “The web is crazy," she says of her family history, talking to BAZAAR on a recent Zoom, "but it all makes sense when you sit down and really try to dissect it. All of these stories are so vivid. I recreate the scenes in how I interpret them.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lee paints in a graphic, almost cartoon-like style. Her color palette is striking and intense (vivid greens, brash reds, blues, and of course black), but not agitating. The influence of artist George Condo is detectable, but it’s not reductive–the styling of her subjects, the emotive aspect of her paintings, and the overt Blackness allow for Lee’s visual language to stand on its own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Lee, black is the richest of all colors and is symbolic of the Black diaspora’s richness in culture. Used across many of her works, it does not stand, thematically, for darkness; it simply depicts skin tone. Three core figures appear over and over in her art: The Gentleman, The Lady, and The Demon. The first two represent familiar human experiences and emotions. The demon, however, serves to represent vices, insecurities, and imperfections.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Those are the types of things that attract me,” she says. "Never did I think that it would be considered a high, elevated art, or some type of fine art. It’s something I’ve always been drawn to, and it just so happened that artists that I ended up discovering that have come before me are considered the elite artists of the world, which proved to me that art doesn’t have to have the cleanest lines or be the most realistic.”</p><img alt="mia lee hot fun mia chicago artist" title="mia lee hot fun mia chicago artist" width=1920 height=1179 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/view-4-1675187449.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lee is interested in the universalities across the diaspora, citing the “head nod,” for example, a gesture many Black folks use to acknowledge each other in passing. “It’s those things that we get that no one ever will, and we will never have to explain them,” she says.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“One of the first paintings I did was The Gentleman in Green. He was sitting on a crate, and for me, that experience is being on the south side and just being outside. It’s casual, that’s the seating we use. I’ve got people in New York telling me that’s what they do, too. People in the South, as well. It’s the casual way of life on a hot day. These are cultural experiences that we’ve carried on for so long.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lee's family encouraged her to pursue art from the jump. “My grandmother went to Tuskeegee and got a degree in piano,” she says. “How many Black women do you know from that era that did that?” They poured into her, which in turn, motivated her to explore the many realms of art and culture: piano, fashion design, visual art–literally anything she showed an interest in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like many creatives, Lee found the period of lockdown to be a turning point in experimentation. She took advantage of the fact that most of us had resorted to spending all of our time on our phones, which meant that she could become hyper-visible if she was active on social media. She admits to being content crazy at the time, but her growing online presence managed help her sell her first painting, Gentleman in Green, in 2021. You don’t have to scroll deep into Lee’s instagram to pick up on how cool she is; it's immediately clear that she has authentic style, a dope circle of friends, and a strong sense of identity as an artist with love for her community. It makes sense that she has been tapped for fashion collaborations, since her personal style is just as striking as her work: She's a sneaker head with an affinity for street wear, but there’s also a sexiness she implements with the help of silk scarves, furry hats, and feminine denim silhouettes that hug the body.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also speaks fondly of the Chicago art scene. She’s so anchored to it that she's thinking not only about planting seeds for the current class, but also so that those coming after her will have a the kind of access that high art institutions don’t typically grant to young creators of color. “I love the trajectory that we’re currently on. It’s been a collaborative effort where we aren’t trying to gatekeep things,” she boasts. “Chicago is such a cool city; we don’t need to be like New York or LA. It’s not gonna happen. We want to carve out our own space.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lee is adamant, however, that support is crucial to the success of any independent artist. She recognizes that it’s okay to have help and it’s okay to recognize when you can’t juggle a booming career on your own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“By the end of 2021, my career started to pick up rapidly. I had been managing my own deals on behalf of myself which became super overwhelming. Then I met the best human alive, Kendall Hurns [of Arte House],” she explains. “I mention him because I really want to stress to people that you don't have to do things alone. I've been blessed with a team who understands me and holds me down to the fullest.”</p><img alt="mia lee chicago hot fun mia" title="mia lee chicago hot fun mia" width=1920 height=1374 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bad-for-you-1675187716.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2022, she collaborated with Chance the Rapper on an interdisciplinary work titled, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcZsfqcBiog" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“YAH know,”" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>“YAH know,”</u></a> which was unveiled at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).

Now, she’s venturing into an additional medium: fashion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Style has always been in her orbit. As a kid, she used to sew doll clothes from the scraps of her grandmother’s sewing projects. She even got a degree in costume design at the University of Illinois, and uses her knowledge of dress to depict her figures in vibrant silhouettes. In addition to visual arts, Lee experiments with textiles, having created silk scarves and durags that feature selected artworks and original patterns—one of them landing her the opportunity to design a capsule collection for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/brands/mia-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Urban Outfitters." data-vars-ga-product-id=8c7b76fd-1ea3-4b49-b831-1452cb90b4bf data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/brands/mia-lee data-product-url=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/brands/mia-lee data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanoutfitters.com%2Fbrands%2Fmia-lee" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/ZcY0/urbanoutfitters","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand=urbanoutfitters.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=526a25a9-8cd8-4e9c-8c19-b4baf67d0f92 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=urbanoutfitters.com class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090"><u>Urban Outfitters.</u></a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I had a friend who bought one of my scarves and wore it to a wedding and someone at the wedding from Urban got in touch with me. I always envision my prints on clothes, but I don’t consider myself a clothing designer. I’m not reinventing silhouettes, but I knew that if I did it, I wanted it to be a genderless collection,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With genderless fashion as the starting point for the collection, she knew she wanted to use textures like mohair to emphasize the element of coziness she wanted to bring to it. There are also silk signatures that draw back to her scarves, which contribute to the elevated vision that she had for the capsule. “It’s just big cozy energy,” she says of the ethos. “We’ve been stressing for the past year. And not only cozy, but being more experimental. Let’s wear these crazy-ass patterns! Let’s get out of these norms and let’s be freer with how we dress and express ourselves through clothing.”</p><p><h2 class="css-19ilr8l e1bddzxd0">Urban Outfitters Mía Lee UO Exclusive Graphic Crew Neck Sweater</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$125 at Urban Outfitters for Mía Lee UO Exclusive Graphic Crew Neck Sweater" data-href=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/mia-lee-uo-exclusive-graphic-crew-neck-sweater data-product-url=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/mia-lee-uo-exclusive-graphic-crew-neck-sweater data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanoutfitters.com%2Fshop%2Fmia-lee-uo-exclusive-graphic-crew-neck-sweater" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/ZcXz/urbanoutfitters-mia-lee-uo-exclusive-graphic","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$125 at Urban Outfitters" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/mia-lee-uo-exclusive-graphic-crew-neck-sweater data-vars-ga-product-brand="Urban Outfitters" data-vars-ga-product-id=56089f87-f034-418f-bb3a-87df36161cff data-vars-ga-product-price=$125.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1c30de4a-3dc4-4ed4-9f3c-8aae287403ba data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Urban Outfitters" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Pullovers data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=urbanoutfitters_mia-lee-uo-exclusive-graphic-crew-neck-sweater data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"><img alt="Mía Lee UO Exclusive Graphic Crew Neck Sweater" title="Mía Lee UO Exclusive Graphic Crew Neck Sweater" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1675187829-79658019_012_d.jpg width=976 height=1463 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Mia ascends as a multi-hyphenate creative, she wants to continue to conquer through fashion and accessories.
