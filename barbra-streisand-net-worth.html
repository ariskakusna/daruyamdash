She is an American singer and an icon of the stage and screen.&nbsp; What a voice she has!&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you are not a fan of the type of music Barbra sings, you have to recognize what a talented singer she is.&nbsp; Her music career has been outstanding.&nbsp; Streisand has also made her mark behind the scenes in television producing and directing.&nbsp; What has this woman not done?&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=who-is-barbra-streisand>Who Is Barbra Streisand?</h2><p>Anyone who has purchased a Barbra Streisand album can tell you who she is.&nbsp; Or perhaps they saw her in Funny Girl, or any other Broadway hit Streisand starred&nbsp;in.&nbsp; Not only has Streisand had a highly successful music career, but she has been called one of the most commercially successful entertainers in history.&nbsp; She has starred in films, on stage, and in a musical comedy or two.&nbsp; Barbra would tell you she has enjoyed every minute of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the achievements of Barbra Streisand are the winning ten Grammy Awards, five Emmy Awards, and two Academy Awards.&nbsp; Since those days, Barbra has made a name for herself in television production and directing and a personal endeavor known as the Streisand Foundation.&nbsp; Although she is currently in her early 80s, don’t expect her to retire anytime soon fully.&nbsp; She will likely remain active in some form of show business until the end of her life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=early-days-of-barbra-streisand>Early Days of Barbra Streisand</h2><p>Barbara Joan Barbra Streisand was born and raised in a Jewish family on April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York.&nbsp; Her father was Emanuel Streisand, who passed away when she was a mere toddler.&nbsp; Streisand’s&nbsp;mother was Diana Ida Rosen Streisand.</p><p>Mother Streisand could have pursued a musical career herself but instead chose to become a school secretary.&nbsp; Barbra often struggled to gain the approval and attention of her mother.&nbsp; She has an older brother named Sheldon Streisand and a younger half-sister named Roslyn Kind.&nbsp;</p><p>Streisand’s early educational days began in the Jewish Orthodox Yeshiva in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Much later, she went to Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and was an honor student.&nbsp; Fellow musical icon Neil Diamond was a classmate of hers.&nbsp; Barbra’s mother did not want her to have a career in show business.&nbsp; Fortunately for the entertainment industry, she did not listen.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=career-beginnings-of-barbra-streisand>Career Beginnings of Barbra Streisand</h2><p>Streisand’s first professional engagement was as a singer in the Bon Soir nightclub in September of 1960.&nbsp; She opened for famous <a href=#>comedienne</a> Phyllis Diller.&nbsp; Although Barbra really wanted to be an actress, she discovered the best pathway to doing that was as a singer first.&nbsp; She was compared to established female singers like Judy Garland and Lena Horne in her early days.&nbsp; She even garnered positive reviews from theater critics like Leonard Harris.</p><p>Moving on to the early 1960s, Barbra was booked into the upscale nightclub the Blue Angel in Manhattan, New York.&nbsp; She hired a personal manager named Martin Erlichman.&nbsp; On the recent Tonight Show with <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a>, Streisand told Fallon that Erlichman was still her manager after more than 50 years.&nbsp; She said he is a fantastic manager.&nbsp; Fast-forward to today, and you can see she was correct.&nbsp; Barbra has had a phenomenal career.&nbsp; She is one of the highest-earning female musicians in the world and ranks up there with the likes of Elvis Presley and <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.lolwot.com/michael-jackson-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jackson</a>.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=other-career-and-personal-highlights-for-barbra>Other Career and Personal Highlights&nbsp;for Barbra</h2><p>She has earned Grammy’s Lifetime Achievement Award, won eight Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, and a Tony Award.&nbsp; Streisand’s best-selling albums are still selling on the market today as she is a most-beloved entertainer.&nbsp; Nowadays, she makes her name as a film director and a film producer.&nbsp; Personally, her relationship with actor James Brolin has drawn as much admiration as her career.&nbsp; Both are still going strong.&nbsp;</p><p>From 1963 until 1971, Streisand was married to actor Elliott Gould.&nbsp; They have one son together named Jason Gould.&nbsp; She married James Brolin on July 1, 1998.&nbsp; They do not have children together, but he has two from prior marriages.&nbsp; Streisand and Brolin are still married today and doing well.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=what-is-next-for-barbra-streisand>What is Next for Barbra Streisand?</h2><p>As of 2022, she had plans to go out on tour, giving her legions of fans worldwide a chance to see her perform.&nbsp; Barbra is on the heels of another top-ten album that was released in 2021.&nbsp; It was called Return 2 Me.&nbsp; She also had plans to become the chairperson of the Performing Arts Center in New York City.&nbsp; That will be located at the new World Trade Center site, which is scheduled to open in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep your eyes and ears peeled for more career news from Barbra.&nbsp; At 80, she shows no signs of slowing down or desire to retire from show business.&nbsp; Her business endeavors behind the scenes are sure to flourish as well.&nbsp; Streisand loves to be diversified in her career activities.&nbsp; Fans of this iconic star can expect to see more from her in the future.&nbsp;
