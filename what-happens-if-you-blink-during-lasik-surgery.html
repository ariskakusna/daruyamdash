Thanks to advanced LASIK technologies in Billings, your eyes will remain comfortably steady as our doctors provide the vision correction results you need to see as clearly as possible.</span></span><h2>What happens if you look around during Laser Eye Surgery?</h2>There is still an incredibly minor lag between the laser noticing your eye has moved and compensating for that movement. However, it is not enough to impact the treatment. All this goes to say that if you move, look the other way, or suddenly blink during Laser Eye Surgery, the procedure will not be affected.<h2>Can you be knocked out during LASIK?</h2>Unfortunately, patients should be awake for LASIK surgery. No, the doctors aren't sadists who want to watch you squirm. Actually, being put to sleep during LASIK does more harm than good. In order for the doctor to perform optimally, he or she needs your cooperation, and therefore, your cognizance.<h2>Are eyes paralyzed during LASIK?</h2>No, the laser has an advanced tracking device which follows your small eye movements during the surgery.<h2>What if I sneeze during LASIK?</h2>If you sneeze, move or blink during the treatment, the laser tracks your eye over one thousand times per second and adjusts the laser to make certain the laser is applied to exactly the right place. So, there is no reason to worry if you sneeze during LASIK.<h2>Can you blink during LASIK surgery?</h2><p></p><h2>Do they stick a needle in your eye for LASIK?</h2>Injections and Needles are not used during LASIK laser eye surgery. Instead, topical anesthetic drops are the only type of anesthesia used to numb the eye during laser surgery.<h2>How do you not blink during LASIK?</h2>During the procedure, the eyelids are held open with a small medical device to prevent blinking. It is therefore impossible for you to close your eye or blink during the procedure. We keep the surface of your eye lubricated with drops, so your eye does not get dry, and you will not feel the need to blink.<h2>Can I sneeze after LASIK?</h2>Sneezing, blinking, coughing or any other involuntary movement will not affect the outcome of the LASIK procedure.<h2>Is LASIK painful?</h2>Fortunately, LASIK eye surgery is not painful. Right before your procedure, your surgeon will place numbing eye drops into both of your eyes. While you may still feel a little bit of pressure during the procedure, you should not feel any pain.<h2>Does LASIK last forever?</h2>While the effects of LASIK surgery are permanent, the benefits can decrease over time. For most patients, the results of LASIK will last a lifetime. About 10-12% of patients nationwide will need an enhancement surgery because of anatomical changes to the eye/eyes.<h2>What drug do they give you before LASIK?</h2>Before the procedure starts, you have the option of taking 10mg of valium to help you relax. This is completely your decision whether you would like to take the pill or not. Prior to entering the laser room, Dr. Alsheikh will look at your eyes in a slit lamp and make sure everything is ready to go.<h2>Does LASIK fix astigmatism?</h2>The ultra-precise lasers used for LASIK surgery can be programmed to reshape the cornea so the front surface of the eye is more symmetrical, thereby eliminating vision problems caused by astigmatism. Most of the time astigmatism can be fully corrected with a single LASIK procedure.<h2>What is the success rate of LASIK?</h2>Though the success can vary from patient to patient, the vast majority of those who undergo LASIK surgery achieve excellent results. It's estimated that around 92 percent of patients achieve vision of 20/40 or better.<h2>How long is vision blurry after LASIK?</h2>While you will see better the day after surgery, your vision may be a bit blurry or hazy immediately afterward. These temporary vision difficulties usually clear up after the first few weeks. However, it can take about 2 – 3 months before your vision fully stabilizes and your eyes completely heal.<h2>Why is vision blurry after LASIK?</h2>Answer: Blurred vision after hours on the computer is generally due to dryness, which is common for six months after LASIK. It is best to use artificial tears at least every hour if you are going to be on the computer and to rest your eyes frequently (actually close them for a few moments) to keep them from drying out.<h2>What will I see during LASIK?</h2>During LASIK, You Cannot See the Laser Coming Toward You — It is Invisible and Painless! The laser that is used during LASIK laser eye surgery is both painless and invisible. It can't be seen because it is outside the visible spectrum of light.<h2>How long after LASIK Can I see 20 20?</h2>During a LASIK procedure, a laser is used to change the shape of one or both corneas to improve vision. According to the American Refractive Surgery Council, more than 90% of LASIK patients achieve 20/20 vision or better after 2 to 3 months of post-surgery recovery.<h2>Are you awake during LASIK?</h2>LASIK surgery is so quick—it only takes a few minutes—that patients only need local anesthesia in the form of eye drops. These completely numb the eyes but you will be completely awake for the entire surgery. To make you feel comfortable and relaxed, the eye surgeons explain every step of the surgery.<h2>What age is recommended for LASIK?</h2>In general, the average age range for getting LASIK is between 20 and 40 years of age. The FDA has approved LASIK eye surgery for those 18 years and older, but most providers will encourage patients to wait until their mid-20s after their prescription has stabilized.<h2>Are eyes more sensitive after LASIK?</h2>Is light sensitivity common after LASIK? Yes, this is a common side effect that LASIK patients experience, so do not worry. It will last for a few days, though many patients notice the light sensitivity diminish relatively quickly. This is a sign of your cornea healing.<h2>Does LASIK use anesthesia?</h2>LASIK is not like most surgical procedures because general anesthesia is not necessary. While some patients may prefer the idea of being “put to sleep” for the duration of their procedure, it is actually very important that LASIK patients be alert and able to follow directions during the surgery.<h2>Do they laser both eyes at the same time?</h2>Are both eyes treated at the same time? With both LASIK and LASEK laser eye surgery procedures, surgery will be performed on a single eye at a time. Both eyes are usually treated on the same day.<h2>How do you shower after LASIK?</h2>Nunnery advise patients that it is okay to bathe or shower normally the day after your LASIK eye surgery. For the first week after your LASIK surgery, it's important to keep water, soap, hair care products and/or washing liquids away from the eye. Do not rub your eyes while bathing.<h2>What happens if you don't sleep after LASIK?</h2>It's okay if you don't fall asleep. The act of closing your eyes and resting them can make a big difference during the recovery process. When you close your eyes, make sure to wear the eye shields provided. They aren't pretty, but they get the job done and make sure your eyes stay safe while sleeping.<h2>How much should you sleep after LASIK?</h2>Rest Your Eyes<p>Sleeping a minimum of 6 hours will help your corneas continue to heal. If you have insomnia, or “just don't need much sleep,” you should consult with your surgeon to discuss the best way to give your eyes the rest they need during the first couple of nights after your LASIK surgery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNrGSinl2uvLZ5waWgp6NdmcKztc2gZKWZo564br%2FUq56eqqk%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vegamour-end-of-year-sale-2022-7089940.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What to Shop From Vegamours End of Year Sale">&larr;
