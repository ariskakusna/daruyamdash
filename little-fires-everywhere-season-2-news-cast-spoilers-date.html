The short answer is, we don't know. Since it's premiere in mid March, Little Fires has been touted as a miniseries, but that doesn't mean hope for another installment is completely lost, right? Could plans be changed now that the series scored <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.emmys.com/shows/little-fires-everywhere data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="five Emmy nominations too" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">five Emmy nominations too</a>? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">There are no official plans for Season 2, but the showrunner would "love" to do it.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tigelaar told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/little-fires-everywhere-finale-ending-changes-explained.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vulture class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vulture</a>, "Personally, I would love to do a season two because this was the best creative experience of my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, there's some hesitancy about how to continue the story while honoring the source material. "My issue with season two is, I don’t know how Elena and Mia ever come together in an organic way," she continued. Tigelaar also told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thewrap.com/little-fires-everywhere-ending-book-hulu-series-elena-mia-pearl-izzy-doesnt-set-fire/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Wrap" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Wrap</a>, "Put it this way—with how it ends, I don’t know how Elena and Mia ever come into each other’s orbits again. I don’t know what a show is like if they are never in the same place, crossing each other again.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To Vulture, the showrunner also said, "So, yes, I do think there are stories to tell. But that’s more of a spinoff than a second season. It’s hard to say good-bye, but there’s something about trying to extend it past its shelf life that I feel would dishonor what it was. It’s hard to say that because I would love to work in that writers’ room for the rest of my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tigelaar also told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/little-fires-everywhere-second-season/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Entertainment Weekly</a>, "I'd be open to it in terms of this is the best job I've ever had." But she believes the story should end where it does. "In my heart, I feel like this is what it's always been, which is a limited series. It's a show with a beginning, middle, and an end. Everything burns down," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The eight episodes "honor the book," she added. "This is a close-ended story to me and we've ended it where it ends."</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Celeste Ng says "never say never."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also speaking to Vulture, the bestselling author said, "You never say never, right?" She cited how Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued the story of Fleabag even though its first season seemed to be an enclosed story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"But I think for me, right now, everything that I know about the characters is on the page," Ng added. "And I think that’s how Liz is feeling about it, too, from having talked to her. But you never know. These characters may come back to me with an idea about more story that needs to be told. Right now, I feel like the series did such a good job of ending where you have an idea of what people’s trajectory is going to be. We don’t see it, but we have an idea of what’s changed for each of them, and from that we can extrapolate."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">One star has expressed interest in another season.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gavin Lewis, who plays one of Elena Richardson's (Reese Witherspoon) four kids, Moody, played with the idea of continuing the series in a recent interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thewrap.com/little-fires-everywhere-moody-gavin-lewis-season-2-possibility/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Wrap" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Wrap</a>.</p>“I think the book definitely has a solid, definite ending. And I don’t want to call it a cliffhanger, but it does leave some possibilities open. And there is, of course, there is always conversation of a second season on a television set. I mean, everybody talks about that. But you never know, that’s something you find out long down the line. I’ve done projects where they’re like, ‘We’re definitely doing a second season!’ and then there’s nothing or a second season comes out later. But I would be more than interested in coming back for a second season. Reese and Kerry are phenomenal and the cast, everybody got along super well. And I think there is plenty more story to be had if the writers decide to come back and do something more."<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We're still waiting on official confirmation from Hulu, though.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Ng also hasn't turned down the idea of a sequel for her book.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two years ago, the author dropped hints about continuing the Little Fires story. Responding to a fan in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodreads.com/questions/1194981-just-finished-little-fires-everywhere-and data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="GoodReads Q&A" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">GoodReads Q&A</a>, she wrote, "Everything I know about the characters in Little Fires Everywhere is in the book--I promise I'm not holding out on you. But with that said, maybe they'll come back to me for more of their story--never say never. :)"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ng is said to be working on her third book, her follow-up to Little Fires, but it's unclear if that will be a sequel to Elena Richardson and Mia Warren's story. In 2018, she tweeted about coming up with new ideas for the forthcoming work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And speaking to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.deseret.com/2019/5/14/20673232/celeste-ng-on-the-little-fires-everywhere-tv-series-her-next-book-and-why-she-likes-to-unsettle-her#celeste-ng-author-of-little-fires-everywhere-is-coming-to-salt-lake-city-on-may-17 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deseret News" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deseret News</a> in 2019, the author said her next book would focus on themes she'll "probably keep coming back to," such as family, race, identity, and womanhood.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">It's not uncommon for a limited series to get renewed.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Look at Big Little Lies, which also starred Witherspoon. After the success of the show's first (and what was supposed to be its only) season, HBO followed up with another chapter, this time adding Meryl Streep for a rare small screen role. Author Liane Moriarty had not written a sequel to her bestselling novel, but did <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newsweek.com/can-you-read-book-big-little-lies-season-2-based-liane-moriarty-wrote-novella-just-hbo-1443254 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pen a 50,000-word novella" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">pen a 50,000-word novella</a> just for the show's second season. Even shows with volumes of source material, like Game of Thrones and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/outlander-season-4-show-vs-book-adaptation.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Outlander class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Outlander</a>, have deviated from their written counterparts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plus, it may benefit Hulu to invest in another installment of Little Fires. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2020/03/little-fires-everywhere-ratings-hulu-rise-in-live-news-binge-viewing-covid-19-crisis-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-1202896063/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a> reported in March that the series had garnered more views in two weeks than any other drama on the streaming platform.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch this space for possible updates.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
