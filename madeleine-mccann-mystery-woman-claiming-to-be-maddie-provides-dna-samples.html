Julia just wants to know the truth about who she is.</p><p>“One of the reasons she made the connection to Madeleine is because one of the suspects in Madeleine’s case looks very much like a man who she says abused her as a child.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“But the same man could be connected to Madeleine and other missing children – this is how predators and traffickers work.</p><p>“Julia has taken a DNA test and we are investigating if it’s possible to check her DNA with that of missing Livia.</p><p>“We are investigating all possibilities at this stage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/V1qoN-ZieqKz-2gaQpViYq23q0o=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/V4NIZYJW7VHJPHIDLYE4FDQL4Q.jpg"><p>Wendell’s family in Poland, meanwhile, have spoken of their “devastation” at her claims.</p><p>“For us as a family, it is obvious that Julia is our daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, cousin, and step-niece. We have memories, we have pictures,” the family said in a Facebook statement, via the Polish missing persons organisation Missing Years Ago.</p><p>“Julia also has these photos, because she took them from the family home with the birth certificate, as well as numerous hospital discharges.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“We always tried to understand all situations that happened with Julia. Numerous therapies, medicines, psychologists, and psychiatrists – Julia had it all guaranteed. She wasn’t left alone.</p><p>“Threats to our address from Julia, her lies and manipulations, activity on the internet. We’ve seen it all and we’ve tried to prevent it, to explain, we’ve asked her to stop.”</p><p>The family hinted at Wendell’s motivations, writing that she “always wanted to be popular”.</p><p>But Johansson urged the family to consider a DNA test, and to “get in touch with us directly so we can discuss the case with them rather than releasing statements online”.</p><p>“Some of the information Julia has told us and the evidence we’ve seen doesn’t match what the family are saying so we would like to talk about it directly with them,” she told <i>The Sun</i>.</p><p>“It seems suspicious to me that Julia’s family will not take a test, which could clear these claims up very quickly.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwucCdnKWdmaOybrnCnJinpl2ixrTAxKuwZq%2Bfoq6vecKlmKKlmaO0bsDOZpmeZZ2WsaW1xGanq6emnrGmv4ydpZplo5a6sbjErGZ6kHmGm5CNsm%2BFepBjfZ93g5STbIx6Zn2clns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1593082-marketers-eager-start-lifting-petrol-dangote-refinery-importation-set-june.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marketers Eager to Lift Petrol From Dangote Refinery as Importation is Set to End in June">&larr;
